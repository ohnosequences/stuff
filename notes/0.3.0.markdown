Added a minimal Maybe (#38), a type for monoids (#21) and several features/improvements related with monoidal categories:

- add symmetric monoidal categories (#43)
- functors for $- ⊗ A, A ⊗ -$, same for $- + A, A + -$ (#39, #40)
- make products a monoidal category (#46)

I'm also starting to use scaladoc (#34) and a purer version of Scala.

There are other additions too that I'm too lazy to write about now.
